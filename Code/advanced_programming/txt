### Hello
This is week 1 Advanced Programming Notes
You're learning how to do C++ and its really hard lol 

- g++ ... will compile your file and 
- // enables you to comment or /* asdfasdf *>

 Python                  || C++
 interpreted/interactive || compiled to binary 
 duck types              || strict types
 whitespace              || {} curlies 
 import                  || #include 


### Loops in C++
 for ( initialise ; condition ; increment )
{
    //code that should be run
}
