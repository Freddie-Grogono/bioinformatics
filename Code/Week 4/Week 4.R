# Week 4

# Data tidying and basic visualization

# Matrices - 2 dimensional containging a single type of data 
# Array are n dimensional matrices containing a single type of data
# Data.Frames (including tibble) can contain multiple data types 
# Lists - structures containing nested information of multiple types 
# Installig packages from CRAN via 'install.packages('package.name")
# Installing packages from GitHub via 'install_github("r-lib/vroom")
# We can specify a function to be used from a certain package using the :: operator: vroom:vroom()
# Load data into R using vroom() via direct pathways, or using a relative pathways
# Load data from GitHub using vroom() and the data URL 
# Creating piplines via the magrittr operator %>%
# Reshaping data from wide to long and long to wide using the pivot_ function

# Today:
# Tidyverse to further delve into some data manipulation and then learn how to visualise these data too:


# Data Manipulation 

# Task: load in the Covid_19 Data from last week:
# Installing 'devtools' package
install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)

# Installing the 'devtools' package
library("devtools")

# Installing vroom from GitHub
install_github("r-lib/vroom")

library(vroom)

library(tidyverse)
# Importing the Data
covid_data <- vroom("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrit88/Bioinformatics_data/master/Workshop%203/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv")

covid_data

# Task: rename the first two columns in the covid data frame to “Province.State” and “Country.Region”.

# Changing the first two names of our data frame:
names(covid_data)[1:2] <- c("Province.State", "Country.Region")

# Now reshape the data into long format:

covid_data_long <- covid_data %>% # magrittr operator < https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/ >
  pivot_longer(col = -c(Province.State:Long),
               names_to = "Date",
               values_to = "Deaths"
                        )

covid_data_long

# 5 Common Themes of Tidyverse data manipulations: 

mutate() # adds new variables that are functions of existing variables 
select() # picks variables based on their names 
filter () # picks cases based on their values 
summarise() # reduces multiple values down to a single summary 
arrange() # changes the ordering of the rows 

group_by() # specify the groups within the data we want to apply these to 


# With our data lets find out:

# 1. what the total number of deaths are (globally)
# 2. what the number of deaths per day are (globally)
# 3. number of deaths per million people in the country 

# Calculate things like the number of deaths per million people we need to know the number of
# people which live in each country - the covid doesn't include this so we need to go fishing 

# Accessing the WORLD BANK data using 'wbstats'
# installing web stats:
install.packages("wbstats") 

# Task
# Install wbstats (best to install it from its github repository, try googling in) and load it into R, 
# and find and have a look at its vignette online (google) 

# Remember to use the top right button: 'Tools', 'Install Packages', 'CRAN'... to install pacakges 
devtools::install_github("nset-ornl/wbstats")

# then make sure we have got access to the wbstats data library 
library(wbstats)

# Task
# Extract the population data for all countries
covid_data_long <- wb_data(indicator = "SP.POP.TOTL", 
                    start_date = 2002, 
                    end_date = 2020)


# Convert it to a tibble
covid_data_long <- as_tibble(covid_data_long)

# The maximum value of the years in the date column
max(covid_data_long$date)

# Filtering Data

# Filter words with the logical operators we discussed in the first workshop:
# < https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html >

# the Filter() uses the logical operators, also other functions like between() 

# Task: we want the data from 2020 so we can use this as our filtering argument:

# 1. filter the data to include data from the year 2020 only:
pop_2020 <- covid_data_long %>%
  # 2. only return data where the data is equal to the maximum value in the column "date"
  filter(date == 2020)

# look at the data:
pop_2020

# 2.3 Cleaning Data:

# Once we join these two data frames we can use the information from the WB to calculate 
# some statistics in the covid data (like deaths per million people). However, before we 
# think about making this join we need to do some careful consideration of whether we can 
# actually join the two data sets in their current form.

# Have a look at the structure of the two data sets: 
#1:
covid_long
#2:
pop_2020

# Take the total population data for each country from the WB data and add 
# it as a new column to the covid data
# Easier to visualise when we look at the unique values in the 'country' column:

##the first 10 and last 10 unique values in the country column
## the ; operature acts as a new line - meaning you can run two bits of code which don't interact on the same line
head(unique(pop_2020$country), 10); tail(unique(pop_2020$country), 10)

# Not a big problem: 
# we can drop the values for 'countries' in the pop_2020 data set which don't match 
# the countries we have in the covid data. 

# Two bigger issues which will become more apparent later on
head(covid_dat, 10)

# The 1st problem is the names of the countries - names of the countries 
# The 2nd major problem is the 'province.state. column in the covid data. 
# Lets look at Australia


## just look at the data from Australia:
covid_data %>% filter(Country.Region == "Australia")

# It is easier to use the wide (not long) here because we can see waht is going on
# in the 'Province.State' and 'Country.Region' column when they aren't repeated over and over 



# Task
# Now filter the WB data to only show the data from Australia, and compare this to 
# the covid data. 
# What are the differences?
## the data for Australia from the WB

pop_2020 %>% filter(country == "Australia")

# This data is not split by state or province 
# We need to convert the covid data so that we have total covid deaths for a country, not region 

# We can do this using the 'tidyverse' and the 'summarise()' function:

# summarise() allows us to specify what function we want to be applied: e.g mean(), sd() or in our case sum(), 
# **It will then create a new column of a specified,name containing that data**  

# We can pair this up with group_by() function, where we can specify the groups in which
# we want the summarize function to be applied to. 

# e.g. mean(), sd(), or in our case sum()
# and will create a new column of a specified name containing that data.

# We can pair this up with the group_by() function, where we can specify the groups in which we 
# want the summarize function to be applied to. 

# we now have a very powerful tool for rapidly and easily summarizing data which is complex
# It is also very easily read by humans lel

# TASK:

## have a look at the data.frame that is produced:
covid_country
# Make a new data.frame from the old covid_long data.frame
covid_country <- covid_long %>% 
  
  # we want to calculate the number of deaths in each country and at each date: 
  group_by(Country.Region, Date) %>% 
  
  ## and we want the sum of the "Death" column in these groups:
  summarise(Deaths = sum(Deaths))


# we have removed the regions so the death toll is per country

#look at the first row of the WB data:
tail(pop_2020)

# Download the countrycode package on CRAN (remember the tools --> install packages)

library(countrycode)

?countrycode #what is country code? 

covid_country$code <- countrycode()

## add a column to covid data containing the 
covid_country$code <- countrycode(covid_country$Country.Region, 
                                  origin = "country.name", 
                                  destination = "iso3c")

##look at the new column we have added to the data set:
head(covid_country, 1)

##compare that to the values in the WB data
pop_2020 %>% filter(iso3c == "AFG")


# 2.4 Joining Data

# So now we have sorted the covid data out
# we want to joing the population data from the WB to it 

# Look on the tidyverse website to see which join() function we want 

# REMEMBER that: full_join() keeps all of the columns AND rows for both x and y 
# remember we have countries in the covid_data and countries 
# AND economic areas in the WB data, so we want to drop these economic areas 
# and just stick to the countries.

# We can do this using LEFT_JOIN() < https://www.programmingr.com/tutorial/left-join-in-r/#:~:text=A%20left%20join%20in%20R%20is%20a%20merge,do%20not%20already%20exist%20in%20the%20first%20table. >

# left_join returns all rows from x, and all columns from x and y
# adding this to our cleaned data set covid_country via our new code column 
# and the corresponding column of codes in the WB data 
# need to make sure we selece the correct column of codes as there are a few!

# We don't want ALL the columns of the WBdata, so we can use the select() function to specify
# we only want the iso3c and value columns to be included in our join:

# rename the 5th column of the pop data so it works:
names(pop_2020)[5] <- "value"

# demonstration of what select does: 
head(pop_2020 %>% select(iso3c, value))


## now join the 2 data sets using left_join

covid_w_pop <- left_join(covid_country, 
                         pop_2020 %>% select(iso3c, value),
                         by = c("code" = "iso3c"))
                          # telling join() that "code" = "iso3c" 
                          # otherwise _join() won't work out where to join the data sets.

# look at new data set:

covid_w_pop

# we could have joined these data by country and by date using:

                        # by = c("code" = "country", "date" = "Date")
# however, we already filtered out the correct year from WB data AND the date in the covid data set is month/day/year
# so we would need to extract the year data AND the most recent data is year 2020 in the covid data
# and only 2019 in the WB data 

# Letw now change the name of the "value" column to one which is more meaningful:

# We do this using the which() function which takes a logical operator 
# in this case names(covid_w_pop) == "value" - and returns a vector of numbers which is the 
# positions in the vecotr where the statement is true: 

# column names
names(covid_w_pop)
# so they are : "Country.Region", "Date", "Deaths", "Code", "Value"

# the ones which are equal to "value":

names(covid_w_pop) == "value"
# is: FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TURE

which(names(covid_w_pop) == "value")

names(covid_w_pop)[5]

# This means you don’t have to specify the location of the “value” manually 
# (i.e. don’t need to do names(covid_w_pop)[5]) 
# so if it ever changes position this code will still work.

# change the name:
names(covid_w_pop)[which(names(covid_w_pop) == "value")] <- "Population"

names(covid_w_pop)[5] # checking this you can now see the name has been changed

# Another quick visual check filtering out a single coutry from each data set 
# and visually check that the population data are the same in each:

## quick visual check
covid_w_pop %>% filter(Country.Region=="Afghanistan" & Date == "1/22/20") 

pop_2020 %>% filter(country=="Afghanistan")

# Now we have joined the data together and done some cleaning we can start to calculate out the 
# statistics we want and then start to think about visualising them.

# 2.5 - Calculating Death Rates

# what the total number of deaths are
# what the number of deaths per day are (globally)
# number of deaths per million people in the country


# Total Global Deaths: 
# the data is cumulative, so the total deaths will be the sum of the data for all countries
# in the most recent date in the data frame 

most_recent <- covid_country%>% # defining what the most recent year is 
  filter(Date == max(covid_country$Date)) # using the fitler function to find this 

sum(most_recent$Deaths) # then summing the final year of data cumulative deaths 

# Number of deaths per day globally:

# need to group the data to calculate this: 
# need to save it as a new data.frame: 

global_deaths_day <- covid_country%>% # so we have assigned the global_deaths from covid data
  group_by(Date) %>% # we are then grouping the Date data 
  summarise("Global.deaths" = sum(Deaths)) 


# Lets make a quick check to ensure we don't have any issues in the data (like NAs):
which(is.na(global_deaths_day$Global.deaths)) 

# Great, it doesn't seem like we have any NAs (otherwise the calculation about would 
# be a series of numbers corresponding to the rows in which those NA values are). 
# We can trivially remove any NA’s in our data using the na.rm=T argument:

# making a new data frame of the global deaths using group_by() and summarise()

global_deaths_day_1 <- covid_country %>%
  group_by(Date) %>% 
  summarise("Global.deaths" = sum(Deaths, na.rm = T)) # removing the NA values wiht na.rm = T

# 2.7 Deaths Per Million people:
# This normalised death rate allows us to compare the reate of increase in deaths
# between countries which have vastly different population sizes

# lets go back to the covid_w_pop data set 
# calculate deaths per million individuals for all of the countries in the covid_w_pop data.

covid_w_pop$Deaths.p.m <- (covid_w_pop$Deaths / covid_w_pop$Population) * 1000000

# look @ the data:
tail(covid_w_pop)

# 3 Visualising Data
# we now have 2 data frames:
# global_deaths_day & covid_w_pop
# we're going to use ggplot within tidyverse to visualise data

# ggplot is very widely used:
# ggplot is already installed as we have already installed tidyverse

# 3.1 Basics of Plotting using ggplot()
# ggplot is very similar to stacking arguments like pivot_() or _join()

# 1st start with ggplot()
# ggplot is very asthetic
# to pass asthetic argumetns use the aes() argument 

# making our first ggplot using the Global.Deaths we used earlier

ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes(x = Date, y = Global.deaths))

# we haven't actually plotted anything just yet 
# we haven't told ggplot to plot anything, also the x axis looks really bad here

# lets try again by using a scatter plot, they're good for visualising the data to begin with 
# trying again 

## make a ggplot object
ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes(x = Date, y = Global.deaths)) + 
  ##add a geom to that object (in this case geom_point)
  ## notice the + after the ggplot() argument which allows us to 
  ##split this over multiple lines
  geom_point()

# Checking the data again: 
global_deaths_day

# The date is being treated as a character vector and is thus plotting them in 'order' ( 0 -> 9)

# We need to tell R that the column is full of dates. This is also why ggplot() has plotted every 
# single value of the “Date” column - it doesnt know how to simplfy this data and so just presents 
# all of it as if it were a categorical variable. ]
# We can solve these issues using as.Date() from base R:

# telling R that the tata is a date: 
# need to specify the format the date data are given in using "%m/%d/%y" 
## (see ?as.Date for help on what this means)

global_deaths_day$Date.corrected <- as.Date(
  global_deaths_day$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")

# Now if we try to plot these data again: using or new column of corrected dates we get: 

ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes(x = Date.corrected, y = Global.deaths)) + geom_point()

# Now the data are visually looking good 

# 3.3 The power of geom_..()
# Geoms
# geoms can stack assuming they can be plotted on the same axis, and we don't have to recode anything 


## a scatter plot
ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes(x = Date.corrected, y = Global.deaths)) + 
  ## points
  geom_point()
## a line plot
ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes(x = Date.corrected, y = Global.deaths)) + 
  ## lines
  geom_line()

# so above we now have two graphs: a plotted scatter graph and a line graph 


## a scatter and line plot
ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes(x = Date.corrected, y = Global.deaths)) + 
  ## points
  geom_point(col = "darkgrey") +
  ## and lines! 
  geom_line(col = "red") 

# the above combined poth a point and a line graph, specifying differnt colours 
# you're able to distinguish between them on the plot
# you can manually choose the colour using 'col ='
# ggplot will layer the lines/points/etc in the order you specify 

ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes(x = Date.corrected, y = Global.deaths)) + 
  geom_line(col = "red") +
  geom_point(col = "darkgrey") 

# Lots of geoms @ < https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ > 

# 3.3 Splitting up your ggplot arguments
# Complex plots are facilitated by the splitting your ggplot() arguments across multiple statements

# make the ggplot an object:

p1 <- ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes (x = Date.corrected, y = Global.deaths))

# add the graphic (in this case )

p1 <- p1 + geom_line()

p1 + geom_point()

# You can also make two verions of the same graphic which are a little different
# and then compare how they look: 

p1 <- ggplot(data = global_deaths_day, aes (x = Date.corrected, y = Global.deaths))

p1 <- p1 + geom_line()

p2 <- p1 + geom_point()

p1
p2

# 3.4 Grouped Data: 
# most powerful element of ggplot is the way it deals with grouped data
# most data aren't as simple as above 

# under the superficial code you see and use it accesses all the tools of the tidyverse
# and thus can group and segregate data really efficiently to plot it 

# moving to our more complex data set: 

covid_w_pop

# Now we want to plot the data by country so we can visualise how the virus has spread over time 
# in different places across the world 
# there are a couple of ways of doing this in ggplot()

# 3.4.1 
# Colors:

# the first is to set some of the aesthetics of the plot to reflect the fact that 
# these are groups within data.

# Create a new column in the covid_w_pop data which contains the datae in the correct format 

covid_w_pop$Date.corrected <- as.Date(
  covid_w_pop$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")

names(covid_w_pop)[7] <- "Date.corrected"

covid_w_pop      



# making a new ggplot graph:

by_country <- ggplot(data = covid_w_pop, aes(x = Date.corrected, y = Deaths))
by_country

# We want to add points to this colored by different countries 
# ggplot() can do this automatically using another aesthetic 
# argument - col. 

# Then we want to add points to this coloured by the 
# different countries. ggplot() can do this automatically 
# using another aesthetic argument - col. We used col above 
# to specify a single colour for a set of points/lines, but 
# if we put it inside the aesthetics argument aes() then we 
# can make ggplot automatically assign colours 
# remember specifying columns via aes() means ggplot looks 
# in our data for a column matching that name, like it did 
# for the x and y variables. So below we tell ggplot to look f
# or a column called Country.Region in our data frame, and 
# then assign a different colour (col) to each of the groups 
# of data in Country.Region:

by_country + geom_point(aes(col = Country.Region))

# You can't see this plot because the legend is so big 
# theme() allows us to change a load of the visual aspects
# without interfering with the data being plotted 

# making the ggplot object

by_country + geom_point(aes(col = Country.Region)) + theme(legend.position = "none")

# Now we can see the ggplot() can be with really complex data
# A very simple argument aes(col = Country.Region) has made a 
# plot with all data from all countries plotted together 

# it is messy though: 
# make a vector of countries we want to look at: 

selec_countries <- c("United Kingdom", "China", "US", "Italy", "France", "Germany")

# use this to filter by for our plot. here using the " %in% " operature: 

sel_country_plot <- ggplot(data = covid_w_pop %>%
                             filter(Country.Region %in% selec_countries),
                           aes(x = Date.corrected, y = Deaths))

sel_country_plot + geom_line(aes(col = Country.Region))

# the above is a little complicated but read through it over and it does make a lot of sense
# 1. when you use the aes() in any of the functions of ggplot() (eg. geom_line()) it will
# look in the data specified when setting up the original ggplot() 
# you don't need to tell it to look in that data each time you add a new funciton 

# 2. this is what happens when you try to plot a line plot that has groups of data,
# but you don't tell ggplot() that it has groups of data: 

## with no grouping
sel_country_plot + geom_line()
# ggplot() will plot the data, but there will be a single 
# line connecting all of the data points 
# (this is why I tend to plot data out with geom_point() 
# for initial visualization).

# 3.4.1.2 point/line types 
# you can alter the asthetics of either the points or lines which are plotted for each country.
# again, ggplot makes this easy 

# set line type by country:

sel_country_plot + geom_line(aes(linetype = Country.Region))

# set line TYPE by country:
sel_country_plot + geom_point(aes(shape = Country.Region))

# 3.4.2 Faceting:
# The other major way to plot grouped data is to spread the data
# use facets to spread data across different sub-plots 

# facet_wrap() or facet_grid() can take up to two groups to facet by 
# facet_grid() forces the plots to be on a grid
# facet_wrap puts them onto a grid but allows the positions to not be determined by the groups

# Because you aren’t speficying an aesthetic you dont need 
# the aes() argument for the facet_() functions but you need 
# to use the ~ operature - which in R speak means “as a function 
# So we want to facet our data as a function of Country.Region. 
# If you have two groups to facet by, you specify them as facet_wrap(x ~ y).
# In our case we only have one, so we replace the x with a .:

# facet the data by country:
sel_country_plot + geom_line() + facet_wrap(. ~ Country.Region)
# split up the data, keeping the axis the same though 
# we can also now stack arguments 

# facet the data by country:
sel_country_plot + geom_line(aes(col = Country.Region)) + facet_wrap(. ~Country.Region)
# so the data that has been plotted similarly, you've just set the aesthetic to vary between plots 

# 3.5 Saving Plots 
# save plots using the pdf function
?pdf()

# the best way is to save the load

# The pdf() function is a little unusual in that we run it to 
# start R making a pdf, then we run out code which prints our 
# plot, and then we use dev.off() to stop the pdf() function 
# and finish making the pdf:

##specify the directory and name of the pdf, and the width and height
pdf("../Plots/Week 4/sel_country_plot.pdf", width = 6, height = 4)

##run your code to print your plot
sel_country_plot + 
  ##add lines
  geom_line(aes(col = Country.Region)) + 
  ##add facets
  facet_wrap(. ~ Country.Region)

##stop the pdf function and finish the .pdf file
dev.off()
